        <h1>The Motion</h1>
        <p>The motion is one of the most important parts of a debate. It is also the main topic of the debate. People debate about the motion; either against or with the motion. If you don't have an opinion, you shouldn't participate in the debate.</p>
        <p>When you enter a debate, you should make sure you have a solid opinion about the motion. If you don't, there is a good chance the other team will beat you.</p>
        <p>The motion is usually unknown to debaters until a set time period before the debate. After you know the motion, you start researching facts that you can use against your opposing team.</p>
        <h1>The Proposition</h1>
        <p>The proposition, also called the affirmation, isn't a matter of what. It's a matter of who. The proposition is the team in favor of the motion. For example, if the debate was about Google Pixel phones, the people who were on the side of Google Pixel phones would be the proposition. Basically, the proposition is the team of people on the side of the motion.</p>
        <h1>The Negative</h1>
        <p>Are you against the topic of the debate? You can be on the negative! The negative is the exact opposite of the proposition. People on the negative are against the topic of the debate, or the motion.</p>
        <p>Despite the name, the negative is not a bad side to be on. The proposition and negative are both the exact same. The only difference is that they have different opinions on the motion. If you don't like the motion, it's okay! The negative is your team and has the same opinion about the motion as you.</p>
