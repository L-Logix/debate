        <p>The motion is one of the most important parts of a debate. It is also the main topic of the debate. People debate about the motion; either against or with the motion. If you don't have an opinion, you shouldn't participate in the debate.</p>
        <p>When you enter a debate, you should make sure you have a solid opinion about the motion. If you don't, there is a good chance the other team will beat you.</p>
        <p>The motion is usually unknown to debaters until a set time period before the debate. After you know the motion, you start researching facts that you can use against your opposing team.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.tv5q79dl5rug" target="_blank"><h1>The Proposition</h1></a>
        <p>The proposition, also called the affirmation, isn't a matter of what. It's a matter of who. The proposition is the team in favor of the motion. For example, if the debate was about Google Pixel phones, the people who were on the side of Google Pixel phones would be the proposition. Basically, the proposition is the team of people on the side of the motion.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.akzvw4rcpqos" target="_blank"><h1>The Negative</h1></a>
        <p>Are you against the topic of the debate? You can be on the negative! The negative is the exact opposite of the proposition. People on the negative are against the topic of the debate, or the motion.</p>
        <p>Despite the name, the negative is not a bad side to be on. The proposition and negative are both the exact same. The only difference is that they have different opinions on the motion. If you don't like the motion, it's okay! The negative is your team and has the same opinion about the motion as you.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.x864kbhhrnmx" target="_blank"><h1>The Abuse</h1></a>
        <p>The abuse is the arguments made by a side that prevents both sides from completing on equal ground. According to debateresources.com's Debate Guide, "This refers to arguments, assumptions, or definitions made by one side that prevent both sides from completing on equal ground.  Abusive assumptions skew the round in favor of one team."</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.z5mu5t4zsi14" target="_blank"><h1>The Burden of Proof</h1></a>
        <p>A burden of proof is a debater who brings forth an argument that has to proven valid before accepted. When competing in Lincoln-Douglas debates, affirmative teams always have the burden to prove the resolution true. Meanwhile, the negative has the burden to prove the resolution false.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.7mdo5v5o01pr" target="_blank"><h1>The Card</h1></a>
        <p>A sheet, notecard, or material with notes that are a piece of evidence with a claim and/or warrant.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.5r8ccohs4ewo" target="_blank"><h1>The Constructive</h1></a>
        <p>These speeches introduce debater's position and advocacy. These speeches are always the first two.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.1h1sjv0r0po" target="_blank"><h1>The Criterion</h1></a>
        <p>This is a necessary standard for judges and others to measure competing values.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.taguuoq0xko2" target="_blank"><h1>The Contention</h1></a>
        <p>A contention is the major argument featured in a debate.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.fowz4fx6ghqw" target="_blank"><h1>Cross-Examination, aka Cross-X</h1></a>
        <p>The cross-examination is where on debater asks questions about another debaters arguments.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.tp0ape1u0t1h" target="_blank"><h1>Crystallize</h1></a>
        <p>When you crystallize a debate, you wrap it up by addressing your most important arguments and offering voting issues that could be key.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.j42dqh1pvxs5" target="_blank"><h1>The Flow</h1></a>
        <p>Flow is a note-taking technique that lets debaters and judges flow through the round and keep track of all the arguments made.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.9loco8nnvudw" target="_blank"><h1>Prep Time</h1></a>
        <p>You have 4 minutes to prepare for a debate that takes place with the format of Lincoln-Douglas.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.usqzyndweflf" target="_blank"><h1>Resolution</h1></a>
        <p>The resolution is similar to the motion, but not exactly the same. The resolution brings up the issues and describes what each team represents.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.25k07d9cakqt" target="_blank"><h1>Spread</h1></a>
        <p>Spreading involves bringing forth many arguments at once, which causes the other team to not be able to answer them all. As debateresources.com points out, "This is an ineffective strategy, as the judge often can't make out major points."</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/view?tab=t.88kxv96vbt7h" target="_blank"><h1>Status Quo</h1></a>
        <p>A status quo is the current situation the debate is occurring in. A negative debater should never let the affirmative forces make you defend the status quo.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/edit?tab=t.64xeogachljq" target="_blank"><h1>The Value</h1></a>
        <p>A value is and idea that a debater argue is paramount. The debater will usually present philosophical background to explain their value.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/edit?tab=t.whgscubob09q" target="_blank"><h1>Key Voting Issue</h1></a>
        <p>Both teams make these throught debates, though they are usually used in the final speech. This is a reason to affirm or negate the motion. They are arguments that have been won by one side or another that conclude that the resolution is true or false.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/edit?tab=t.wsip5xrefpb" target="_blank"><h1>Warrant</h1></a>
        <p>A warrant is a reason backed with logic that tells people why your claim is true. If an argument has no warrant, some judges may ignore it.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUzstIvzCEjYVpyGa9krOeh0lvzldh9CEFC2DprQa04/edit?tab=t.bfgj4iga9t32" target="_blank"><h1>Dropped Point</h1></a>
        <p>When your opponent drops your point, they have failed to acknowledge it during their time. This means most judges will assume it is to be a concession.</p>
