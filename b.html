    <h1>Step 1: Create a Research Question<br></h1>
    <p>Creating a research question is a key step in being a successful debater. To create a good one, start with the question: what am I researching? Then, you are able to expand on the topic, adding who/what/when/where/how/why to the question. Finally, ensure that your question is answerable. Sometimes questions are too hard to answer and have to be dropped.<br><br></p>
    <h1>Step 2: Avoid Questionable Research Practices<br></h1>
    <p>Make sure all of your sources are reliable before gathering evidence and data from them. Make sure to save them somewhere so that you know where your sources came from. Make sure to cite them in the text or at the end.<br><br></p>
    <h1>Step 3: Report and Put Together All Findings<br></h1>
    <p>Finally, put together your findings into one, single report with every little detail you want to include.</p>
