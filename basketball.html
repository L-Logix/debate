        <h1>Basketball Analogy Intro<br></h1>
        <p>The basketball analogy is an easy way to think of debate in a non-debate enviornment. Right now, you are a basketball coach for a college of your choice. There are two possible groups that you have to choose from for your team. However, you will have to choose one or the other, not mix or match.</p>
        <h1>The Teams<br></h1>
        <p>On one side of the gym, there is a team of tall players. However, these players are also very slow during play. The other side of the gym features short but fast players. You have to choose one of these groups to play for the team. Which will you choose?</p>
        <h1>The Questions<br></h1>
        <p>Now, you have a dilemma. You are required to select a group to play for your team. However, you have either have a team fully comprimised of tall and slow people or a team fully comprimised of short and fast people. Which would you choose? Below are the questions you would have to ask yourself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is your goal as the college's basketball coach?</li>
            <li>As the basketball coach, how will you achieve that goal?</li>
            <li>What will ensure that you succeed in your goal?</li>
            <li>Which team (tall/slow or short/fast) will be more successful at reaching this goal?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The diagram below shows an example scenario where the coach wishes to get to the NCAA championship. He decides that his team needs to score more points. Now, he has to choose a team based on what shots he wants them to make: 3 Points, 2 Points, or Free Throw.</p>

        <h1>The Complications<br></h1>
        <p>Complicating our discussion is the defense part of the game. In basketball, there are three defensive ways to prevent the opposing team from scoring points.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stealing the ball</li>
            <li>Blocking a shot</li>
            <li>Rebounding the ball</li>
        </ul>
