        <h1>Basketball Analogy Intro<br></h1>
        <p>The basketball analogy is an easy way to think of debate in a non-debate enviornment. Right now, you are a basketball coach for a college of your choice. There are two possible groups that you have to choose from for your team. However, you will have to choose one or the other, not mix or match.</p>
        <h1>The Teams<br></h1>
        <p>On one side of the gym, there is a team of tall players. However, these players are also very slow during play. The other side of the gym features short but fast players. You have to choose one of these groups to play for the team. Which will you choose?</p>
