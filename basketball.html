        <h1>Basketball Analogy Intro</h1>
        <p>To introduce you to this concept, we will use the words of Dr. Seth Halvorson and Cherian Koshy. "On one side of the gym, you have a group of very tall players though they also happen to be very slow (think Yao Ming). On the other side of the gym, you have a group of short players that are also very fast (think Earl Boykins). You are required to select one group or the other to play for your team so that you will have a team entirely comprised of tall and slow players or a team entirely comprised of short and fast players. How would you make your decision? The first question to ask yourself is what is your goal as the collegeâ€™s basketball coach? For most college programs, their goal is to reach the NCAA Final Four and the collegiate national championship. While there may be other important tournaments and rivalries, the NCAA Championship is the most important for Division I teams."</p>
